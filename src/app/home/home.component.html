<h2>
  Testing of Force Layout with D3
</h2>

<p>This application was build to test a problem with zomming and panning a D3 Force Layout graph.</p>

<p>All are built with D3 V4 on HTML5 Canvas using the Angular 2 cli (http://cli.angular.io).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Zoom-Pan-Drag demonstrates gragging dots around the screen. This page is modifed from <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2b534b091d80a8de39219dd076b316cd">Drag & Zoom</a></li>
  <li>Force Canvas demonstrates a Force Layout graph with dragging but no zoom and pan. This page is modifed from <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ad70335eeef6d167bc36fd3c04378048">Force Dragging III</a>, but nodes are locked in position after release.</li>
  <li>Force Canvas+Zoom and Pan demonstrates Force Layout with dragging AND zoom and pan. To replicate error: zoom in, drag a node, and watch the node move faster than your mouse.</li>
  <li>Single Node Force Canvas+Zoom and Pan uses only a single node in the JSON data to simplify debugging. The browser console will some reporting of the dragged position of the node.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<h2>Primary Question:</h2>
In example 3 above, when zoomed in, why does a node not track the mouse dragging it? Zoom transformation is not correctly applied.

<h2>Secondary Questions:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In the import 'import * as d3 from "d3";' the d3 is not recognized although I have npm installed d3 and the latest typings</li>
  <li>When switching betten item 2) above ("Force Canvas") and item 3) above ("Force Canvas+Zoom and Pan"), the graph is almost (but not quite) identical, even after dragging items. Is the d3 model a singleton? </li>
</ul>
